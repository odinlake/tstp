there is always a third course	966	life lesson			That redundancy, a copy which does not add value while the original is around, can in fact be a good thing (because the original may break) is featured. As “redundancy” is often a byword for “waste”, the observation is perhaps worth making.	
there is strength in unity	1463	life lesson		what is beauty	The idea is posited that real beauty does not come from make-up and such mundane trappings, but is a thing of the soul.	Ruth, Magda and Eve found that they didn’t need the Venus drug to be beautiful because their beauty stemmed from increased self-confidence and not the drug in tos1x03 "Mudd's Women".
there is value in diversity	967	life lesson			The idea is posited that dark emotions such as anger, jealousy, and fear, which we usually detest, actually serve a meaningful purpose.

there is value in experience	1464	life lesson			The age old observation that things which are ugly on the surface can yet be good and beautiful on the inside is featured.

there is value in redundancy	724	life lesson			The time tested wisdom that, no matter how much you want it, you can’t force someone to love you.	Amanda used her Q powers to make Riker act as if he loved her in tng6x06 "True Q" but it wasn’t genuine love.
true beauty comes from within	1472	life lesson			Someone takes great risks in order to gain an advantage in life.

male posturing	857	male stereotype			People employ weapons of mass destruction, a.k.a. WMDs, and threaten planetary civilization.	
male protectiveness	858	male stereotype			Civilization simply stagnates and becomes weak to the point where it may not be capable of safeguarding its own continuation.	
manliness	665	male stereotype			People use cloning instead of natural methods to reproduce, but minute errors in the repeated copying compound until further replication becomes impossible.	The colonist of scientists on Mariposa could not propagate their race further because of degraded DNA in tng2x18 "Up The Long Ladder" and (being scientists) obviously had no idea how to do it the old fashioned way.
what men want	1523	male stereotype			People invent a new technology but it has unforseen consequences and civilization collapses.	
annihilation by WMDs	446	man-made existential risk			People overexploit a vital resource on which they depend and civilization collapses.	The Salt Vampires of planet M-113 were on the road to extinction as their planet had run out of salt in tos1x05 "The Man Trap". Where exactly the salt went is unclear but perhaps they ate it all.
atrophied civilization	339	man-made existential risk		annihilation by WMDs	A single device capable of ending life on a planet (or worse) is featured.	Captain Picard destroyed the Tox Uthat, a devise capable of stopping nuclear fusion in a star, rather than risk letting it fall into the hands of the Vorgons in tng3x19 "Captain's Holiday".
cloning-related replicative fading	1082	man-made existential risk			People pollute the environment upon which they depend to the point of total collapse and everyone dies from starvation etc.	
danger from a new technology	789	man-made existential risk			After finding the means of satisfying their needs in a fantasy world, people simply stop trying to achieve even the minimum needed to persist.	
depletion of a vital natural resource	1124	man-made existential risk			War primarily caused by religious differences is fought on so wide a scale that it imperils all life in a galaxy.	The ancient artifact “The Soul of Skorr” could have ignited a holy war throughout the galaxy in tas1x16 "The Jihad", but a team of brave heroes with Kirk in the lead managed to intervene.
doomsday device	525	man-made existential risk			People deliberately create a dangerous pathogen, typically for the purpose of war, but it gets out of control and kills everyone.	The inhabitants of Earth Two sought to increase their lifespan but instead released an infectious virus that quickly killed off all adults in tos1x11 "Miri".
ecological destruction	800	man-made existential risk			Something goes wrong during a scientific experiment, and everyone dies. Perhaps a particle accelerator created a black hole. Stupid scientists.	
everyone escapes to a fantasy world and civilization collapses	804	man-made existential risk			People just keep on reproducing until all the planets resources are depleted and everyone dies from starvation etc.	The Gideans had extended their own lifespans remarkably but were completely unable to control their own reproduction and had so overpopulated their planet that people lived literally shoulder to shoulder in tos3x17 "The Mark of Gideon".
galaxy-wide holy war	1167	man-made existential risk			A severely depleted ozone layer leaves civilization exposed to deadly UV radiation.	The Aldeans had gone sterile in tng1x17 "When The Bough Breaks" as a result of their planet’s ozone layer having become depleted.
man-made pandemic	547	man-made existential risk			People come to rely on a single central computer, but it crashes and everyone dies. That’s a real “blue screen of death”.	The Bynar’s central computer was knocked out by an electromagnetic pulse in tng1x15 "11001001" and they nearly perished.
out of control scientific experiment	884	man-made existential risk	AI		People construct clever machines but the machines become too clever and decide to kill everyone. They won’t be back.	
overpopulated planet	1275	man-made existential risk			People start relying on technology for everything and loose their ability to cope creatively with novel problems that may arise in the future. When something does, everybody dies.	The Aldeans of tng1x17 "When The Bough Breaks" had remarkable technology, including a planetary invisibility cloak, but it was all controlled by a central computer which they no longer understood, so they became helpless when the computer broke down.
ozone layer depletion	1276	man-made existential risk			People create weapons systems (killer robots etc.) that can function all on their own but things get out of hand and the weapons kill everyone.	
reliance on a central computer	480	man-made existential risk			People wage war on each other and (often with the help of WMDs) wipe each other out in a mutual apocalypse.	
rise of the machines	429	man-made existential risk			An entire planet designed and constructed by some sentient race.	A mysterious planetoid turned out to be a wholly artificial artifact of a long gone alien civilization in tos3x14 "That Which Survives".
slaves to technology	1354	man-made existential risk			A device capable of protecting its host planet by deflecting incoming asteroids.

domed city	798	mastering space			A people travels outside its original solar system. Note: As space travel is present as the backdrop in every Star Trek episode, the theme is used only when a particular point is made about it in the story line.	Captain Picard explained the Federation’s mission in detail in tng1x01 "Encounter at Farpoint".
Dyson sphere	1010	mastering space			An entire planet designed and constructed as an oversized amusement park.	The sole purpose of the Shore Leave Planet of tos1x17 "Shore Leave" and tas1x09 "Once Upon a Planet" was to provide amusement to weary space travelers.

geoengineered planet	534	mastering space			A device capable of rendering a whole planet invisible.	The Aldeans had such a device in tng1x17 "When The Bough Breaks" and it had made them complacent.
interstellar space travel	1210	mastering space			An entire moon is used as a dumping ground for prisoners.	
magical amusement planet	856	mastering space			A sentient race spreads its civilization to other planets.	The Enterprise found an Earth colony flourishing on Omicron Ceti III in tos1x25 “This Side of Paradise” in spite of lethal levels of berthold radiation on their planet.
mining a planet from orbit	1251	mastering space			A library placed in space to keep it safe from the various dangers, social and environmental, that constantly threaten it on a planet.

telepathic alien	219	mentally distinguished life form			The question is posed: Is there a cosmic principle or eternal omnipotent entity at work in the universe?	Captain Picard soliloquised on the possible existence of a higher power at work in the cosmos in tng2x02 "Where Silence Has Lease".
telepathically linked aliens	937	mentally distinguished life form			The tricky, as yet sci-fi:ish, question of what precisely constitutes ones “personhood” is posed: Is it DNA, the body, the brain, memories, something elusive called the “soul,” or a combination of these? What happens, legally and ethically, if some of these are copied or transferred somehow?	
ultra-rational alien	316	mentally distinguished life form			It is discussed what precisely human “creativity” is and from whence it comes.

is there a higher power	1213	metaphysics			The fundamental philosophical question of “what is real” is discussed. Might everything we perceive be an illusion or is there something we can identify as certainly real?	Living out a life as a villager named Karmin on the planet Kataan felt very real to Captain Picard in tng5x25 "The Inner Light", but in reality it was all an elaborate fiction produced by an alien probe.
personal identity	329	metaphysics			The definition of sentience is discussed. Here as in most sci-fi the word “sentient” is taken to mean intelligent and self-aware. That, however, still leaves much to be questioned.	how could Picard tell whether he was transported to an alternate world or whether he was just crazy
the nature of creativity	950	metaphysics			The notion that all we are and all we know is just a simulation within a larger reality is featured.	Dr. James Moriarty was to unwittingly live out his simulated life in a simulated universe in tng6x12 "Ship in a Bottle", but who knows: maybe we all are?
the nature of memory	1439	metaphysics			The slippery definition of what constitutes “life” is discussed. Nature has a way of befuddling biologists whenever they think they may have pinned it down, and sci-fi can of course speedily go beyond nature into the purely hypothetical.	
the nature of reality	1441	metaphysics			The subtle question of what it means for something to be “natural” contra “unnatural” is discussed. For example: since most people die before reaching 90, is it unnatural to live longer than that? What about 100? 500?	
the nature of sentience	294	metaphysics		personal identity	The technology to duplicate a person, or at least a person’s mind.

2D beings	1004	miscellaneous life form	aliens		A life form that is microscopic in size, yet (astonishingly when compared to a common brain) is considered sentient.	The “Microbrains” of Velara III were tiny, yet somehow sentient, crystals in tng1x18 "Home Soil".
alien composed of autonomous parts	1031	miscellaneous life form	aliens		A very special ape-like carnivore with claws and fur, sharp venomous teeth, and an enormous horn in the middle of the head.	This affront to the theory of evolution appeared in tos2x16 "A Private Little War".

In past this has meant sterilizing or killing “undesirable” people, and subsidizing the procreation of “desirable” people. 	Doctor Stavos Keniclius 5 made a failed bid to create a galactic master race of giant Spock clones in tas1x07 “The Infinite Vulcan” - a giant Spock, of course, being the measure of eugenic perfection.

trust in intentions vs. trust in judgement	733	personal practical dilemma	Plutchik-emotion	interest, vigilance	A character feels that something significant but inevitable is about to happen.

the theory of evolution	722	topics in science			Doctor McCoy sums it up best in tos1x08 "Balance of Terror": " In this galaxy, there's a mathematical probability of three million Earth-type planets. And in all of the universe, three million million galaxies like this. And in all of that, and perhaps more, only one of each of us. Don't destroy the one named Kirk."	MyCoy waxed lyrical in tos1x08 "Balance of Terror" on the likelihood of three million Earth-like planets in the Milky Way, and three million million galaxies like it in all the universe, but only one Captain Kirk.
the value of pi	1458	topics in science		the value of pi	A number that is not a root of a non-zero polynomial equation with rational coefficients.	Spock explained that pi is a transcendental number in tos2x07 "Wolf in the Fold".
the value of product testing	964	topics in science			High-yield grain is any variety of ordinary grain that has been bred, genetically modified, or fertilized to increase yield amounts.

the value of testing a hypothesis	723	topics in science			Gunpowder is a mixture of sulfur, charcoal, and potassium nitrate (saltpeter) with the sulfur and charcoal acting as fuels, while the saltpeter functions as an oxidizer.	Captain Kirk knew this well and used the knowledge to defeat his Gorn enemy in the legendary fight to the death in tos1x19 "Arena".
the vastness of the universe	1459	topics in science			Typically, the pulling of a trigger causes a hammer to snap forward and trigger an explosion (of some sort) that propels a bullet out from an elongated metal barrel at high velocity and in the direction of a designated target.	The Klingons supplied primitive townspeople on planet Neural with increasingly advanced firearms with which to wage war against the local hill people in tos2x16 “A Private Little War”.
transcendental numbers	1470	topics in science			At the heart of it an oil lamp is nothing more than an oil-filled receptacle with a wick sticking out of it. The lighting of the lamp results in a steady flame being emitted from the tip of the wick.	Kirk impressed the space Native Americans of planet Amerind by inventing an oil lamp in tos3x03 "The Paradise Syndrome" while suffering from amnesia.

the mechanics of firearms	1432	topics in technology			The category of tough decisions that involve choices that are hard, not because of ethical issues or uncertainty regarding the outcome, but because we do not quite know what we ourselves desire. A typical example is “career choice”.	
the science of oil lamps	1454	topics in technology			The category of tough decisions that involve choices that are hard because they involve moral considerations. Would you, for example, let another person die if that was the only way to save your own life?	
the workings of computers	1460	topics in technology			The category of tough decisions that involve choices that are hard, not because of moral considerations or preferences but simply because the effect of possible choices are less than clear. A typical example is “risk taking vs. playing it safe”: high risk with high reward, or low risk with low reward.	
the workings of irrigation	1461	topics in technology			The category of transnational social issues that centre on the peaceful interaction between sovereign factions in the form of discussion, trade, and posturing as opposed to threats and brute force.

apprehension	87	unpleasant emotion			Someone feels ashamed or self-conscious about themself in front of others.	Spock was mortified at the prospect of having to explain the nature of his secret Vulcan mating urges to Captain Kirk in tos2x05 "Amok Time".
boredom	212	unpleasant emotion	Plutchik-emotion	apprehension, terror	Someone experiences anxiety about the near future in a way that rises above "apprehension", but is not so intense that they loose self-control and scream out in "terror". This theme is typically used when a character percieves a clear and present physical danger.	Beverly revealed her fear of heights to Captain Picard in tng7x08 “Attached”.

fear for one's life	461	unpleasant emotion	Plutchik-emotion	pensiveness, sadness	A character exhibits that deep "sadness" which comes with loosing someone near and dear. This typically involves the rending of garments and shedding of tears as the character loses self-control.	Captain Kirk both rued and lamented the loss crewman Hendorff in tos2x09 “The Apple”. Hendorff, a token redshirt, was shot with poison darts by a pod plant.
fear of an unknown future	815	unpleasant emotion	Plutchik-emotion	boredom, disgust	Someone exhibits a feeling of "disgust" so intense that it cannot be concealed or suppressed.	Worf loathed Duras and his entire house in tng4x07 "Reunion".

loathing	161	unpleasant emotion			Someone feels regret for a past action that they have come to see as morally wrong, or for a mistake they should have been able to avert.	
loneliness	197	unpleasant emotion	Plutchik-emotion	pensiveness, grief	Someoner feels a degree of sorrow for one reason or another that borders between "pensiveness" and outright "grief".	The Enteprise crew was saddened to learn that McCoy had been diagnosed with xenopolycythemia, a rare and terminal illness, in tos3x10 “For the World is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky”.
pensiveness	200	unpleasant emotion			Someone feels bad because of past actions of theirs that they have come to think were wrong, or because they have an unbecoming outwards appearance.	
rage	92	unpleasant emotion	Plutchik-emotion	apprehension, fear	Someone experiences "fear" to the point of panic, i.e., they freeze up or otherwise loose control of themself.	Ensign Haskell died of sheer terror in tng2x02 “Where Silence Has Lease”.
remorse	130	unpleasant emotion			Society is seemingly paradisical because everyone in it shares their love freely without restraint, shame, or envy.	The hedonistic Edo from the planet Rubicun III shared their love freely with anyone who happened to pass by as long (as long as they were of age) in tng1x08 "Justice".
sadness	238	unpleasant emotion			Society is supposedly made perfect through the careful removal of anything undesirable in our genomes.	
shame	358	unpleasant emotion			Society is supposedly made perfect by the introduction of a new breed of human, i.e., version 2.0. Out with the old, in with the new.	Dr. Roger Korby had a dream in tos1x09 “What Are Little Girls Made Of?” that one day mortal human boys and girls will be mind-transfered into the bodies of immortal android boys and girls.  
terror	151	unpleasant emotion			Society is made perfect by the removal of its one failing component: mankind.	Lore and his loyal Borg minions wanted to wipe out the human scourge and make the universe a perfect place in tng7x01 "Descent, Part II".
free love utopia	1161	utopia			Society is seemingly paradisical because everyone just stops being a jerk. 	The tiny alternate universe time continuum Elysia was a veritable utopia where everyone simply got along in tas1x12 "The Time Trap".
genetic engineering utopia	829	utopia			Society is supposedly ideal thanks to being controlled by machines that go about optimizing everybody’s well-being in the best way possible.	
human v2.0	539	utopia			Society is supposedly ideal because it is controlled by an exalted race of individuals who are just better than the rest.	The plant-like Phylosians were so superior that they once decided to take control of the galaxy for its own good, we were told, in tas1x07 "The Infinite Vulcan". The attempt was abortive.
kill all humans utopia	1216	utopia			Society goes back to the perfect state it was once in, after the root of all evil has been made away with: machinery.	
kumbayah utopia	1221	utopia			Society is bliss because it is made up of noble savages who live as one with nature etc., never mind antibiotics and such pointless luxeries.	
machine controlled society	664	utopia			Society is supposedly ideal because it is controlled by a class of exalted individuals who are just wiser than the rest.	The Platonians of tos3x12 "Plato's Stepchildren" modelled their society on this Platonic ideal.
master race controlled society	1244	utopia	AI		Society is perfect thanks to an army of androids that fullfill our every wish.	An army of obedient androids stood ready to bring utopia to the galaxy but were stopped by Captain Kirk and a well aimed logical paradox in tos2x12 "I, Mudd".
neo-luddist utopia	549	utopia			Society is perfect thanks to an army of slaves that just take care of every distasteful chore.	
noble savage utopia	673	utopia			The category of themes that centre around basic rights we believe should be awarded to all human(oid)s irrespective of political circumstances or differences in nationality, religion, ethnicity, etc. 	
Plato's Republic	1018	utopia			The category of themes that highlight ethical questions in medicine. These are awarded its own category due to their popularity in contemporary fiction. Most of us will, after all, be hospitalized at some point in our life.	
utopia on the back of android labor	1480	utopia			The category of themes that compare two distinct ideologies of social order directly against each other. Such discourse has been present at least since ancient Greek days, but is perhaps more recognizable today through the example of the “liberal vs. conservative”.	
utopia on the back of slave labor	979	utopia			The category of themes that highlight tough trade-offs between different ethical considerations in the shaping of government policy and norms of conduct between nations. 	
humanoid rights	83	values and ethics in society			The category of themes themes that represent various ideas about how society could, should, or shouldn't be organized. Here is contained orations about the pros and cons of political ideologies, such as fascism, democracy, communism, etc.	
medical ethics	216	values and ethics in society	AI		We are shown what things might be like from the point of view of a sentient machine.	
social dichotomy	124	values and ethics in society	culture, aliens		We are shown possible alternative customs and traditions that perhaps make us take our own convictions less for granted.	
social ethical dilemma	59	values and ethics in society	aliens		We are shown possible alternative systems of morality that perhaps make us take our own convictions less for granted.	
social order	65	values and ethics in society			We are shown what things might be like from the point of view of an alien species.	
AI point of view	137	views and customs			We are shown what things might be like from other peoples’ points of view.	
alien customs	222	views and customs			We are shown possible ways of thinking about death and the departed.	Most of us feel a measure of respect for the body of a late compatriot, but the Klingons in tng1x20 “Heart of Glory” demonstrated complete disregard for the empty husk of a corpse their friend had recently departed.
alien morals	233	views and customs			We are shown that the perception of what is beautiful or not depends on the observer. What is pretty to one may be ugly to another.	The grotesque looking Horta alien thought that it was the humans that should be pitied for their unsightly appearance in tos1x26 "The Devil in the Dark".
alien point of view	105	views and customs			We are shown what things might be like from the point of view of a child.	
alternate points of view	370	views and customs			We are shown what things might be like from a mentally ill person’s point of view.

beauty is in the eye of the beholder	1058	views and customs			We are shown what things might seem like in the here and now if viewed from a future person’s perspective.	
child's point of view	280	views and customs			We are shown what things might be like from the point of view of an entity that does not itself have a material body.	Ian, the embodiment of a benign incorporeal entity, saw life on the Enterprise-D through incorporeal eyes in tng2x01 "The Child". Note that Ian literally had eyes, but he viewed through them in a figurative manner.
delusional point of view	458	views and customs			We are shown what things might seem like in the here and now if viewed from a past person’s perspective.	
enemy point of view	326	views and customs			We are shown what things might be like from the point of view of a person that comes from a technologically less advanced culture than our own.	
future point of view	215	views and customs			It is illustrated how people of a less advanced culture may perceive the science and technology of a more advanced culture as being, for all intents and purposes, magic. It is something outside the primitives’ understanding of the world.	
incorporeal point of view	466	views and customs			We are shown that moral questions are often not black and white but have many coherent and potentially valid viewpoints in between the extremes.	
past point of view	287	views and customs			We are shown that a group that is seen as vicious terrorists by some may well be seen as heroic freedom fighters by others.	
primitive point of view	357	views and customs			We are shown that the famous people we may admire and worship are only “great” on a very limited human scale. In the larger scheme of things none of us stands out all that much from the rest.	Captain Kirk and his crew were harassed by an alien with unimaginable powers until its parents appeared in tos1x18 "The Squire of Gothos".
science as magic to the primitive	692	views and customs			We are shown what things might be like from the point of view of a being whose abilities are so far beyond us that they seem practically omnipotent, and who therefore is not limited by our own practical concerns.	
shades of gray	432	views and customs			We are shown that, when all is said and done, our similarities to each other by for outweigh the comparatively tiny differences.	Upon finding evidence of a common proto-humanoid ancestor species, Humans, Klingons, Romulans and even Ferengi come to see that they are not as different as they once thought in tng6x20 "The Chase".
terrorist or freedom fighter	435	views and customs			We are shown that in armed conflict, it is often not at all clear who deserves to be labelled the aggressor in the larger view of things.	
the greatest among us is the smallest in another world	1421	views and customs			Two rival factions each strive to improve to their arsenal of weaponry in order to outdo the other and gain an upper hand in the event of a war.	
transcendental point of view	364	views and customs			One faction sells weapons to another faction. To what extent is the seller responsible for the actions carried out with such weapons?	
we're not so different after all	1489	views and customs			Atrocities, such as torture or the mass killing of civilians, are carried out during the course of a war.	
who is the aggressor	998	views and customs			Biological weapons, i.e., man-made diseases, are used in warfare.	
arms race	403	war			A segment of a society takes up arms and violently demand independence or reshaping of government.	
arms trade	592	war			A secret military project is featured.	
atrocities of war	752	war			A faction that wants to make war creates an incident and blames it on the enemy. The real warmongerers can then attack while falsely claiming that their targeted enemy started the hostilities.	The Enterprise-D nearly destroyed a Lysian space station in revenge but then it turned out the whole situation had been orchestrated by the Sataarans in tng5x14 "Conundrum".
biological warfare	597	war			A whole nation or large ethnic group is killed en masse.	
civil war	507	war			A faction systematically uses the military in order to subjugate their neighbours and expand their own power.	
covert military program	783	war			Nuclear weapons are strategically placed in space, in orbit around a planet, from where they can easily be deployed against any desired target.	The Enterprise visited the 20th century and found that Earth was about to go down the path of self-obliteration by putting nukes in orbit in tos2x26 "Assignment: Earth".
false flag operation	1148	war			One faction takes members of another faction as prisoners during the course of a war. The treatment of such prisoners is wrought with potential problems and moral questions.	It was unclear whether Captain Picard was technically a prisoner of war thus protected by a treaty against mistreatment in tng6x11 "Chain of Command, Part II".
genocide	651	war			A people is threatened by an enemy who uncompromisingly wants them all dead and who will not be reasoned with.	
imperialism	658	war			Someone, who can typically be labelled a terrorist, blows themself up while trying to do damage to their perceived enemy at the same time.	
orbital nuclear weapons platform	1271	war			Attacks are characterized as “terrorism” by others. There is no objective definition, but the attacks typically target civilians and the attacker is not a conventional military carrying out normal war operations.	
prisoners of war	1311	war			The terrible impact war has on ordinary people is featured.	
relentless enemy	561	war			Early events that can plausibly be used to explain why a war eventually breaks out are featured.	
suicide bombing	929	war			Two or more sovereign factions fight over territory that they all claim as theirs.	
terrorism	394	war			Two or more sovereign factions fight over a resource that is not under the sole control of any one faction.	
the horrors of war	488	war			A member of a faction decides to take up the cause of an enemy faction against their own.	
transnational conflict over a claimed territory	494	war			The outlandish idea is put forth that war is an immature and undignified way of resolving problems.	
transnational conflict over a shared resource	731	war			The idea is put forth that the deliberate waging of war, horrible as it may be, may sometimes be justified.	Spock argued that war against Nazi Germany was warranted in the lead up to World War II in tos1x28 "The City on the Edge of Forever".
treason	971	war			War (typically civil war) breaks out over who is to become the new leader after the old leader dies.	
war is petty	983	war			The wisdom of the old motto “seize the day” is illustrated, i.e., the idea that it is best for us to make the most of our time right away for who knows what tomorrow may bring.	
war is sometimes justified	1487	war			Someone shares their love freely and (at least ostensibly) accepts that others do the same. This is as opposed to monogamy and being jealous about a partners love affairs.	The hedonistic Edo from the planet Rubicun III shared their love freely in tng1x08 "Justice".
war of succession	984	war			Someone strives (more or less sincerely) towards knowledge, understanding, sophistication, and refinement in all matters.	Flint was an insufferable know-it-all smartypants intellectual in tos3x21 "Requiem for Methuselah"; outrageous!
anti-intellectualism	749	way of life			The wisdom of the old motto “be yourself” is featured: one should strive to act in a way that feels natural.	Mudd’s women were trying to act attractive but arguably became more attractive when they stopped acting in tos1x03 "Mudd's Women".
carpe diem	602	way of life			The notion that one should not live underground is featured.	McCoy vehemently objected to underground dwellings in tos3x08 "The Empath".
free love	826	way of life			Someone holds the belief that life is better without machines and that mechanization (relative to some intuitive reference point) is altogether undesirable.	Geordi preferred shaving with an old-fashioned razor over a technologically perfect sonic one in tng1x04 "Code of Honor".
intellectualism	1208	way of life			Someone believes that violence should never be used. In the extreme, a pacifist may feel that violence should not even be used in self-defence against violence.	A replica of the Vulcan philosopher Surak espoused pacifism as a way of life in tos3x22 "The Savage Curtain".
just be yourself	1215	way of life			Someone believes fervently in the causes of their homeland.	
living underground is not natural	1230	way of life			Someone emphasizes tradition and doing things “the good old way” as opposed to embracing new ways of going about it.	
neo-luddism	385	way of life		pascifism	Someone endorses the ethic that we ought to refrain from retaliating when aggrieved. While this could be about physical attacks it is more often used in the context of insults.	The pacifist Dowd turned every cheek on his body in spite of insult and injury (then he ran out and wiped a species of 50 billions clean out existence) in tng3x03 "The Survivors".
pacifism	310	way of life			Someone abstains from eating meat and other animal products on moral grounds.	
patriotism	275	way of life			We imagine what it would be like to age backwards.	The Enterprise was pulled into a negative universe where people started life with old bodies that became ever younger over time in tas2x06 "The Counter-Clock Incident".
traditionalism	492	way of life			We imagine what it would be like if the world our senses reported on became so peculiar that we had to question our own senses and even our sanity.	Sulu couldn't tell whether those were swirling knives out there in space while at the held or whether his eyes were tricking him in tos3x05 "And the Children Shall Lead".
turn the other cheek	1474	way of life		what if I found myself in the body of a child	We imagine what it would be like if our mind moved into a body of the opposite gender.	An old flame took revenge on Captain Kirk by using an alien device to swap bodies with him in tos3x24 "Turnabout Intruder".
vegetarianism	980	way of life		what if I found myself in a body of the opposite sex	We imagine what it would be like if our mind moved into a the body of a child.	A transporter malfunction turned Captain Picard and some of his crew back into children physically but not mentally in tng6x07 "Rascals".
what if I aged backwards	1490	what if I faced an incredible situation			We imagine what it would be like to be in a fight, typically one-on-one, that must end with one contestant dead.	Captain Kirk felt what it was like to be pitted against Spock in the mother of all fights to the death in tos2x05 "Amok Time".
what if i couldn’t trust the veracity of my senses	365	what if I faced an incredible situation			We imagine what it would be like to go on a suicide mission.	Spock piloted a shuttlecraft deep into the Giant Space Amoeba with no reasonable prospect of return in tos2x19 "The Immunity Syndrome".
what if I found myself in a body of the opposite sex	1494	what if I faced an incredible situation			We imagine what it would be like to have to sleep with a complete stranger.	To save their species the Scalosians had to mate with any strangers that happened to pass by in tos3x13 "Wink of an Eye".
what if I found myself in the body of a child	1495	what if I faced an incredible situation			We imagine what it would be like if we suddenly lost our brain. It is probably an odd feeling.
