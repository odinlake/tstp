## Working Definitions

### Story

Any publicly known narrative that can be referenced and analyzed may be a "story" in this project.


### Theme

A theme is any topic that is discussed in a story, however briefly.
To do something useful, however, we need to identify and name themes. 
A *named theme* in this project is required to meet a modicum of conditions.
It should be:

**Well defined and coherent**: 
Ideally the name itself should make it clear. 
This is sometimes possible with common themes.
Either way, every theme should have a rigorous definition written for it.

**Context independent**:
Neither the name nor the definition of a theme should contain story-specific jargon.
Alternate reality type themes should be self-contained ideas that don't necessitate a particular fictional universe.

**Useful**:
There is no point in including themes that are so specific that it is hard to imagine another story containing the same theme.
They make the task of *themeing* harder as they make it difficult to search for suitable themes.
An overly specific theme may be better expressed as the juxtaposition of more generalized themes.

**Interesting**:
A great many trivial observations can be found in any story.
Tables are flat, stairs are exhausting to scale, and things fall down.
These are not generally interesting.
Should the flatness of tables ever be the central topic of a story, the appropriate themes are probably something to do with philosophy and perception.

In short a named theme should be clearly defined independent of specific stories, and be something that one can 
plausibly find in several different stories but do not expect to find in every other story.


### Generalized Theme

Themes can be formulated with different degrees of specificity.
For example, "romantic love" is a kind of "love" which in turn is considered a "pleasant emotion."
Of these three "romantic love" is most specific and "pleasant emotion" most generalized.
Whenever "romantic love" is a theme, "love" and "pleasant emotion" are also themes.
This should be taken as part of the definition for the named theme as used in this project.
If it should become desirable to record that a story featured some "unpleasant emotion" aspects of romantic love, a new named theme may be invented for the purpose.

It has been convenient to organize themes into a structure of step-wise generalizations. 
Thus "pleasant emotion" is said to be a parent of "love" which in turn is a parent of "romantic love."
In technical terms, the resulting structure is called a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
A theme may have multiple parents as it can be generalized in different ways. 
We often consider four distinct subsets of this DAG that are trees rooted in highly generalized named themes: "the human condition", "society", "the pursuit of knowledge", and "alternate reality."
In these subsets, each theme apart from the root has exactly one parent.


### Choice Theme, Major Theme, and Minor Theme

If there is a named theme that meets the requirements above, it may be used as a minor theme (or higher) whenever it is unambiguously featured.
If it is difficult to reach reasonable consensus on whether it was featured or not, use a suitable generalization or omit it.
The rest is highly subjective but the rules of thumb are:

- If a theme is featured throughout most or at least a major part of the story, or if it is purposely part of the conclusion, then it is a major theme.
- Choice themes are whatever we think is really the point of the story, e.g., *the moral of the story* for themes that express moral sentiments.
