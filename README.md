## Working Definitions

### Story

Any publicly known narrative that can be referenced and analyzed may be a "story" in this project.


## What is a Theme?

A theme is any topic that is featured in a story.
A central theme is a theme that is topical throughout most of the story, either because it is featured explicitly or because it is revealed as the "moral of the story" towards the end.
A peripheral theme is any theme of interest that is featured briefly.
In the notes, peripheral themes are called "minor". 
Central themes are called "major" or "choice".
Choice themes are whatever seems to be at the essence of the story.

There are no strict rules for what makes a good theme to include.
There are a few rules of thumb.
Look mostly for major/choice themes.
Prefer to use themes that are already defined.
Don't waste time including uninteresting minor themes but feel free to include what interests you.
Good themes are topics that are featured significantly in various different stories.
Don't introduce themes that are specific to a particular fictional universe; generalize them instead.
Look for themes that are obvious and seem uncontroversial.
Look for themes that expose our human nature through the stories we tell.

"The desire for vengeance", "the horrors of war", "faith vs. reason", "what if I had magical powers", are examples of good themes that we find in many different stories.


### Generalized Theme

Themes can be formulated with different degrees of specificity.
For example, "romantic love" is a kind of "love" which in turn is considered a "pleasant emotion."
Of these three "romantic love" is most specific and "pleasant emotion" most generalized.
Whenever "romantic love" is a theme, "love" and "pleasant emotion" are also themes.
This should be taken as part of the definition for the named theme as used in this project.
If it should become desirable to record that a story featured some "unpleasant emotion" aspects of romantic love, a new named theme may be invented for the purpose.

It has been convenient to organize themes into a structure of step-wise generalizations. 
Thus "pleasant emotion" is said to be a parent of "love" which in turn is a parent of "romantic love."
In technical terms, the resulting structure is called a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
A theme may have multiple parents as it can be generalized in different ways. 
We often consider four distinct subsets of this DAG that are trees rooted in highly generalized named themes: "the human condition", "society", "the pursuit of knowledge", and "alternate reality."
In these subsets, each theme apart from the root has exactly one parent.


### Choice Theme, Major Theme (central themes), and Minor Theme (peripheral theme)

If there is a named theme that meets the requirements above, it may be used as a minor theme (or higher) whenever it is unambiguously featured.
If it is difficult to reach reasonable consensus on whether it was featured or not, use a suitable generalization or omit it.
The rest is by necessity somewhat subjective but the rules of thumb are:

- If a theme is relevant throughout most or at least a major part of the story then it is a major theme. 
- It can be indirectly relevant to a majority of the story if the story leads up to a conclusion that features the theme, and thus a major theme.
- An otherwise major theme may be elevated to a choice theme if we think it explains the story particularly well.

Choice themes are a useful expedient whilst themeing but may be of less value in a statistical analysis.
We may use the expression "Central Themes" to refer to the union set of choice themes and major themes, and "Peripheral Themes" to the set of minor themes for a story.
