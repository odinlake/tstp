## Working Definitions

### Theme

A theme is any topic of a story that is discussed however briefly.
That sounds very simple, and it is.
To do something useful, however, we also need to identify and name themes. 
A named theme in this project is required to meet a modicum of conditions.
It should be:

**Well defined and coherent**: 
Ideally the name should make it clear. 
This is sometimes possible with common themes.
Every theme, however, should have a clear definition written for it.

**Context independent**:
Neither the name nor the definition of a theme should contain story-specific jargon.
Alternate reality type themes should be self-contained ideas that don't necessitate a particular fictional universe.

**Useful**:
There is no point in including themes that are so specific that it is hard to imagine another story containing the same theme.
Indeed they make the task of themeing harder as they make it harder to search for suitable themes.
Sometimes overly specific themes are better expressed as the juxtaposition of two more generalized named themes.

**Interesting**:
A great many trivial topics can be found in any story.
Tables are flat, stairs are exhausting to scale, and things fall down.
These observations are not generally interesting.
Should the flatness of tables ever be the topic of a story, the appropriate themes are probably something to do with philosophy and perception.

The useful/interesting conditions taken together imply that a named theme should be something that we can 
find in several different stories but do not expect to find in every other story.


### Choice Theme, Major Theme and Minor Theme

If there is a named theme that meets the requiremetns above, it may be used as a minor theme (or higher) whenever it is unambiguously featured.
If it is difficullt to reach reasonable consensus on whether it was featured or not, use a suitable generalization or omit it.
The rest is highly subjective but the rules of thumb are:

If a theme is featured throughout most or at least a major part of the story, or if it is purposely part of the conclusion, then it is a major theme.

Choice themes are whatever we think is really the point of the story, e.g., *the moral of the story* for themes that express moral sentiments.
